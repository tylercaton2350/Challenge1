# Challenge1
This is a counter code that I added some env accountId manip code to. This will be augmented to fit the hello world requirements for challenge 1. 
Currently github has issues with false repo-ownership following the 2.6.3 update. When I discover a proper workaround for pushing to this repo - or until github fixes this - I will simply add the critical files to the repo manually.
